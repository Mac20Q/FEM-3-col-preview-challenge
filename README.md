## My process
Jumped in to VS Code and started building. HTML code and classes then sort it out with CSS.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Practice getting things lined up right with flex. Learned how to do the media queries.


### Continued development

Keep learning more about using flex and grid for the responsive sites.
